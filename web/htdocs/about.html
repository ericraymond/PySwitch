    <h2>PySwitch Emulator</h2>
    <br>    
    <a href="https://github.com/Tunetown/PySwitch" target="_blank">PySwitch</a> is an open source firmware for MIDI foot controllers. It has been developed on PaintAudio's MIDI Captain series controllers, to control the Kemper Profiler Devices.
    <br>
    <br>
    This website emulates PySwitch in your browser. See the <a href="https://github.com/Tunetown/PySwitch/blob/main/web/README.md" target="_blank">documentation</a> for details. You can:
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Load the configuration from a connected controller</b> running PySwitch (like a MIDI Captain) via MIDI into the emulator
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Edit the configuration</b> in a user friendly way with a <b>Graphical User Interface</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Save updated configuration files</b> directly to the connected controller via MIDI
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    You have to allow MIDI connections for this website, your browser will ask you automatically for permissions.
    <br>
    Now, it would be just another configuration tool, if you could not do this, too:
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Control any connected client device (like a Kemper Profiler) in realtime</b> from your browser while editing the patches. The emulated device will control your Kemper just like the real one, even when no controller is connected.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Quickly open and test all examples</b> delivered with PySwitch, connected to your <b>real Kemper device</b> or using the built-in virtual Kemper Profiler, all within the browser.
        </li>
        <li>
            Scan for connected controllers and clients automatically
        </li>
        <li>
            Edit the code in sync with the graphical editor: You can use your own implementations, they will not be destroyed by the code generator.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    When you start up the application the first time, it will automatically scan all available MIDI ports for connected controllers. If one is found, it will automatically load its configuration.
    <br>
    <br>
    After a configuration has been loaded, the application scans for available clients to control. The first one found (for example a Kemper Profiler) will be connected, or, if none has been found, a virtual Kemper Profiler is used. You can override this by clicking on the button at the bottom right and selecting a MIDI connection manually.
