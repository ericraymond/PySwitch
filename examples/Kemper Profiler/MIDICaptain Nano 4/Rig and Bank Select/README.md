|------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Switch 1   | Select Rig 1 of current bank | Bank Down                |
| Switch 2   | Select Rig 2 of current bank | Bank Up                  |
| Switch A   | Select Rig 3 of current bank |                          |

**Note that the controller does not know (yet) about an eventual restriction of max. bank (Kemper setting "Max. Banks"), so the shown color does not regard that setting!**
