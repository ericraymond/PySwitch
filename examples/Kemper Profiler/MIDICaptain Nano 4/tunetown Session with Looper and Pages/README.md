## Exampe Description

This is the personal preset for my MIDICaptain Nano 4 which i mainly use on sessions. 

The rig toggle actions are configured to use one of the first three rigs of a bank as basic setting (depends on the guitar i take) and toggle to rig 4 (synth) or 5 (lead) with switches A and B. When you push the switch again, it will return to the main rig you had selected before.

For operating the Looper, switch 2 provides basic, casual functions. With long press on switch B you can change into "Looper Page", which changes the actions on the lower switches to provide more access to functions like half speed/reverse etc.

(\*) If not one of the target rigs (4 and 5) is selected, these always remember the current rig and switch back to it on disabling. This makes it possible to access 3 rigs with one click and only 2 buttons.
