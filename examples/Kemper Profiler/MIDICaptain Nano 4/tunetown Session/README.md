| Switch 1   | Tap Tempo                | Tuner Mode                                       |
| Switch 2   | Global Dly+Reverb Freeze |                                                  |
| Switch A   | Toggle Rig 4 (*)         | Less Reverb Mix (\**)                            |
| Switch B   | Toggle Rig 5 (*)         | More Reverb Mix (\**)                            |

(\*) If not one of the target rigs (4 and 5) is selected, these always remember the current rig and switch back to it on disabling. This makes it possible to access 3 rigs with only 2 buttons.

(\**) This is not implemented yet, will be added in the future.
