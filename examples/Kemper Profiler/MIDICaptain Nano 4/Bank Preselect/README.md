## Exampe Description

This demonstrates the bank preselect actions: Switches 1 and 2 will pre-select banks 1 / 2, without changing anything yet.

Switches A and B will select rigs 2 / 3 if these are not currently selected, else they switch to rig 1. This is useful for example if rig 1 is your main rig, and you have two alternative lead rigs 2 and 3. Any of these three rigs is accessible with one tap at any time.

| Switch     | Action                  |
|------------|-------------------------|
| Switch 1   | Pre-Select Bank 1       |
| Switch 2   | Pre-Select Bank 2       |
| Switch A   | Select rig 2 or 1 (\*)  |
| Switch B   | Select rig 3 or 1 (\**) |

(\*) Selects rig 1 if rig 2 is currently selected, or rig 2 of any other rig is selected.
(\**) Selects rig 1 if rig 3 is currently selected, or rig 3 of any other rig is selected.
