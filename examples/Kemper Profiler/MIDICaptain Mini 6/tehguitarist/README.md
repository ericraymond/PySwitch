## Example Description

This is a custom config that displays a custom display depending on bank number below the rig name. It also uses rig name to determine which effects slot is toggled with swtich 1. 

The bank name reverts to amp name if no custom name is specified. 

The bottom LED on the delay switch also flashes in time with the tap tempo (does not tap tempo itself, I use a player switch for that, which also shows tempo, I just thought it was cool). By way of explanation, rig 2 is skipped because of how I like to organise my profiles, but also which I'm most likely to use. My OD (rig 2) and Lead (rig 5) are switches 1 and 2 on my player.
