## Exampe Description

This example has the four left buttons of the MIDICaptain Mini 6 mapped to the four effect slots of the Player. Switch 3 switches Tuner Mode, Switch C controls a rig volume based volume boost. This sets the rig volume to +6dB when enabled, 0.0dB when disabled, so in case you manage to have all your rig volumes set to 0.0 by default, this serves as a natural volume boost without needing an effect slot (based on https://www.kemper-amps.com/forum/thread/63049-top-tip-gain-a-volume-boost-without-using-an-fx-slot-or-morph-any-unit/?postID=674708#post674708 ).

The display features header and footer for display of the corresponding switch states, as well as a big rig name display and a small display showing the amp name.
