## Exampe Description

This example has the same switch assignment as version 1, but a different display setup: Boost and Tuner Mode now have separate, small displays in the screen for demonstration.

Also the way the display is composed is different (sequential, opposed to the declarative way used in the other examples), also for demonstration.
